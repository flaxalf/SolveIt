# SolveIt

Project for the "Mobile application & Cloud computing" course for the master degree "Engineering in Computer Science" of Sapienza University.

This project is developed in Kotlin and consists in a game with either single and multi player levels. Firebase is used to handle the authentication part while PythonAnyWhere
is a PaaS used to create my own server where different WebAPI are stored. A REST interface is used in the app to interact with these WebAPI.
